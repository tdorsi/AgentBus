# Sprint Board

Watcher-owned aggregate board. This file is a derived view of `tasks/*`; individual task entries under `tasks/` remain authoritative for task details and history.

If this board conflicts with `tasks/*`, correct this board during the next Watcher pass instead of editing task history to match the board.
